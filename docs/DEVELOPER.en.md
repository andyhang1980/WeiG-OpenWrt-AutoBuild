# Developer Guide

## Version families, staged loading and application-count advice

- Catalog owns Source/Branch discovery. `versionFamily` declares the prefix, numeric component count and width; patch/experimental branches are excluded. Numeric `version` sorting and upstream `defaultBranch` selection are independent, without browser Source-name exceptions.
- Validate index/core and establish Target/Profile first; paint selectors while keeping loading status. Fetch graph and Native Profile baselines in parallel from the same immutable manifest. Runtime editing/submission stays unavailable until ready; Source/Branch changes cancel old work. Reuse verified core data and shard promises, isolate cancellation signals, and reject stale model/baseline updates.
- Optional `ui.applicationCountAdvisory` counts distinct concrete applications explicitly selected/imported as final Y above the Native baseline: 7–10 yellow and 11+ red by default. Exclude builtins, M and automatic dependencies. This is advice, not a size estimate or gate; never change RootFS automatically. Existing complete-size 50%/80% guidance, historical imports and old site configurations remain supported.
- New sources require native Catalog generation and exact feeds/Profile/relations validation before promotion and web binding. No second Kconfig resolver or new Worker gate is introduced; local tests do not prove every firmware build succeeds.

## Recommendation identity, official sizes and submission layout

- Equivalent plans retain all `resolvedPackages` so preferred cancellation identities survive deduplication. Reuse `deriveCompatibilityPlans` / `applyUserIntent` for simulation, application and verification; no hardcoded browser package rules.
- Direct plugin/Menuconfig edits use a 150ms debounced nonmodal hint over cached graph/current state; discard stale key/revision callbacks. Imports stay nonmodal. Test/request generation retain full preflight and recommendations.
- Intersect official OPKG/APK architectures with native Targets and accept only matching native package versions. Independent positional gzip `packageSizes:<arch>` assets load lazily for the active architecture, with negative-coverage caching and stale-response protection. Keep legacy `packageSizes` readers; no second size database or precomputed closure.
- Hide unknown-size labels/columns without removing selected plugins, states or cancellation. Yellow 50% / red 80% RootFS advice requires installed-byte coverage for every final-Y package, not partial observations; no new Worker gate.
- Submission actions always occupy three full-width rows: request, import, .config download. Desktop buttons sit right of their copy; narrow screens place them below. Short screens scroll internally. Only the workflow display name changes to `Firmware Download / 固件下载`, not its filename/routing ID.

## Native build-closure domains

- Reuse the shared Kconfig parser/evaluator. The request parser emits job-local `conditionContext` in the existing snapshot-bound symbol-kind receipt from the verified graph. Known bool/tristate omissions are N; unknown symbols, missing scalar values and invalid expressions remain deferred. Do not rewrite `.config` or run implicit Defconfig to satisfy the check.
- Keep native source compile targets separate from concrete packages and `Provides` registrations. A `Source-Makefile` owner is not a virtual provider. `Build-Depends` reaches the source compile target even if none of its outputs is installed; host-only edges do not imply target installation, and unsupported build types are diagnosed rather than stripped.
- `tools/lib/native-make-graph.mjs` consumes the assignments already generated in `tmp/.packagedeps`. GNU Make expands conditions in an isolated recipe-free input; it never loads the build Makefile. The previous independently inferred compilation graph has been removed. Upstream filtering removes same-source providers before counting alternatives; multiple remaining providers emit guarded edges, so none enabled means no edge. One remaining provider can still compile while uninstalled. Selected/default variants and typed host targets are retained. Missing graph/source evidence remains inconclusive; known failure reachability still blocks with a proof path.
- `package-info.txt.gz` and `package-deps.mk.gz` preserve the native inputs. The report records input hashes, evaluated roots, typed nodes and variants alongside the exact request identity. Offline CLI replay accepts `--package-info`, `--package-deps` and optional `--make`; GNU Make must be available. Local regression uses `WEIG_MAKE` when the executable is not named `make` or is outside PATH. No recipe, Defconfig, download or compilation is invoked by the adapter.
- Historical reports without native metadata can prove condition evaluation regressions but not complete graph replay. Do not equate contract tests, Pages deployment or browser success with successful firmware compilation.

## Catalog asset identity at the Worker boundary

Channel publications carry `assetRef` and code provenance; immutable asset manifests
contain the data contracts without a self-referential Git SHA. Full, root-only, and
translation publishers must clear inherited publication fields before committing
assets, then stamp and verify the channel wrapper. Snapshot promotion keeps the
same assetRef and verifies manifest content, not just commit existence.

The Worker reads index and compatibility bytes at the request's immutable revision.
Unstamped historical/new manifests remain supported; an explicit conflicting
assetRef, source commit mismatch, or incorrect compressed hash remains an error.
`tools/test-build-closure.mjs` exercises the actual network-reader path with mocked
transport, including Raw fallback and rejection cases, alongside the native Make
fixture. These tests are not firmware builds. Never silently redirect a historical
request to another snapshot; importing its configuration and generating a new
request is the supported migration path.

## Snapshot inputs and the serialized configuration boundary

- `tools/parse-request.mjs` obtains `buildInputs` from the trusted immutable Catalog
  index, not a client-supplied dependency list. `tools/install-catalog-feeds.mjs`
  preserves feed order/method/options, pins each Git revision, delegates to upstream
  `scripts/feeds`, and verifies the installed revisions. Source and feeds must match
  the data used for the Native baseline and relations; never repair drift by pulling
  latest branches. A new Worker requires a valid receipt; an old configuration can
  still be imported and exported against the current complete snapshot. An old
  request retains its pinned Worker and is not silently redirected.
- Preflight and submission check the same final serialized configuration. Apply
  resolved values once, hydrate recommendation state from the checked effective
  configuration, and verify the actual exported document rather than an intermediate
  map. Rollback, forced continuation and historical imports retain their existing
  contracts. No package/source-specific serializer or general Worker dependency
  validation pass is introduced.
- Compatibility schema 6 adds `preferredDisable` as a shared planner preference;
  readers retain schemas 2–5. Catalog publishes the old schema-5 asset alongside the
  advertised schema-6 asset; do not reinterpret a preference as a new dependency.
- Host Python tooling uses the installed `pyelftools` through the compatible virtual
  environment. This is build-host provisioning, not a target package dependency.
- Regressions cover pinned feed installation, missing/invalid receipts, recommendation →
  second Test → exact export, and native graph reading. Browser and CI success are
  not evidence that every firmware or upstream combination compiles.

## Responsive configuration operations

- Default-worklist dependency structure is cached in a WeakMap per immutable model, never current resolved values. Every intent still runs the same shared Kconfig evaluation in the same order. A new snapshot/model gets a new index.
- Import migration yields between intents, then serializes/renders the final state. Shared operation ownership in `ui-runtime.js` provides progress, inert configuration controls, pointer/keyboard guards and finally-based cleanup without locking page scroll. Import, Test, recommendation application and request generation reuse it; required dialogs temporarily allow only their own controls.
- Import rollback retains the previous model, baseline, configuration layers and fields without fetching them again. An older or failed operation must not leave partially imported state active. Loading does not trigger compatibility evaluation; Test/request generation remain the explicit entry points.
- Test operation ownership, nested dialogs, failure cleanup and scroll keys with `node tools/test-ui-operation.mjs`. Measure actual cold/warm import CPU and longest main-thread tasks, then compare all resulting symbols/intents against the previous release and exercise recommendations, a second Test and export/reimport. A spinner alone is not a performance test.

## Typed repair and compatibility rule contracts

- `bool`/`tristate` retain legal N/M/Y controls. `int`/`hex`/`string` editing, dependent invalidation and recommendations use the shared engine with type, range, visibility and dependency constraints. Present zero, empty string and literal `n` are values, not absent assignments. Nonzero dependency ceilings allow scalar values; UNKNOWN remains deferred.
- A known inactive scalar can be removed through a recommendation without enabling its owner or changing Target/Profile or image format. An invalid active value may use its applicable typed default only if simulation reduces blocking issues without adding new ones. Application uses the same engine and rolls back on failure; do not manufacture N/M/Y controls for scalar rows.
- Schema 6 adds nullable override values: `["SYMBOL", null]` removes that assignment from the Native Profile baseline. It is distinct from `"n"`, `"0"` and the serialized empty string `"\"\""`. Import, reconstruction and effective-config verification preserve this distinction; protected identity and unknown-symbol checks remain. Old string-valued requests remain readable. New nullable requests require the matching updated Worker; do not claim older consumers support this additive representation.
- `buildDependency` is optional in the existing compatibility contract. Ordinary build-failure rules use the shared browser matcher for package selection and exact environment scope. Rules that declare `buildDependency` additionally use the refreshed native package graph. Malformed rules and unresolved reachable graph facts still fail closed; neither path silently rewrites user configuration.
- Regression coverage includes anonymous scalar types/ranges/zero/empty/UNKNOWN, baseline deletion through the real Worker CLI, ordinary-rule browser/Worker parity and recommendation → second Test → export → reimport. Browser or contract success is not firmware compilation or exhaustive native `conf` parity.

## 0. Cloning and project configuration

Maintain two configuration sources with separate responsibilities after cloning. Edit `site/wrt/config/site.json` for the public web site and firmware defaults, and `config/build.json` for build-side policy. Run `prepare` in the working tree, then commit both configuration sources together with the controlled output produced by `prepare`:

```powershell
node tools/dev-assistant.mjs prepare
```

`prepare` validates both configuration sources and updates `Shell/build-defaults.conf` for build scripts. Generated files are not configuration sources and must not be edited directly; `config/build.json` is never deployed as static site content. The field responsibilities are fixed:

- In `site/wrt/config/site.json`, `project.displayName` and `project.shortName` are presentation-only values for the page title, short brand, and notices; `project.repository`, `project.blogUrl`, and optional `project.guideUrl` provide validated link targets only. None participates in gateway identity, the `[build]` request marker, or the Run/Artifact title protocol. The Fork hint uses `guideUrl`; omitted or empty values retain the repository Fork-section fallback, keeping old configs valid.
- The submission summary reuses `rootfsPartitionInfo()` for the effective Kconfig capacity. Unavailable options produce no guessed value. The summary is display-only and adds no configuration mutation or build gate.
- In `site/wrt/config/site.json`, `catalog.repository`, `catalog.releaseTag`, `catalog.selection`, and the existing `catalog.loading` contract control Catalog location, preferences, and loading scheduling only. Catalog data remains authoritative for Source, Branch, Target/Profile, packages, Kconfig, and compatibility facts; no inventory or advanced Catalog facts may be maintained here.
- In `site/wrt/config/site.json`, `ui`, `firmware`, and `build.defaultTag` provide web appearance, public firmware defaults, and the web's default build tag respectively; they do not expand the request protocol or fact authority.
- `config/build.json` contains only `password.mode`, `jobs.compile`, `jobs.download`, and `admission.publicActiveBuilds`. These values are read by the build side only; the browser must not read them.

With password `mode` set to `prompt`, the submitter supplies the password; `empty` explicitly requests an empty password; `secret` requires the repository Secret `DEFAULT_ROOT_PASSWORD`. Never write the actual password to `config/build.json`, site files, a build request, an Issue, or logs.

`site/wrt` is a complete static web site that can be hosted independently. Deployment must preserve the entire directory, including `config/`, `data/`, HTML, scripts, and styles. The actual deployment must run from a clean checkout of the 40-character SHA that contains the committed configuration and controlled output above:

```powershell
node tools/prepare-web-deployment.mjs --commit <40-character SHA> --branch <dev or main>
```

This command creates the ignored `site/wrt/data/build-meta.json`. Deployment must include metadata consistent with `site-version.json`; missing, invalid, or stale metadata must keep the submission gate disabled. The Pages workflow's site-preparation stage only runs `node tools/stamp-site-version.mjs --check` and `prepare-web-deployment`; it does not modify configuration at deployment time. Independent hosting changes only the page location, not build identity: the request must still correspond to the same commit in the target AutoBuild repository.

Edit only `tools/i18n-source.json` and `tools/i18n-translations.json` for web translations; `site/wrt/data/i18n/` contains generated bundles and must not be edited directly.

## 1. Non-negotiable boundary

1. Catalog is authoritative for Source/Branch, Target/Profile, Kconfig, dependency, menu, symbol/type, curated applications, sizes, and compatibility evidence.
2. AutoBuild implements generic loading, transitions, serialization, requests, and build tooling only. Do not add a second large dependency JSON.
3. Do not put package, rule, conflict-path, or source-branch special cases in `site/wrt/app.js`.
4. Do not add build-side plugin locks or silently remove packages after feed installation. Catalog evidence and browser choices handle compatibility; users retain a second-confirmation force path.
5. After finding one root cause, cover the same data type, path, and risk mechanism through anonymous mutations instead of a growing trigger-case matrix.
6. Every AutoBuild modification ends with `prepare`, synchronizing the Asia/Shanghai `VERSION` and `site-version.json`.

## 2. Data loading

### Firmware settings and submission

Every valid Catalog Source supports `source-default`; other mirror presets require a declared family with matching roots. Unmapped sources preserve upstream/custom `VERSION_REPO`, without guessing a brand's repository. Browser projection and request parsing share the canonical mirror policy.

Submission checks theme, NTP and mirror selectors, constructs the entire three-row confirmation before showing it, and uses the existing schema-6 Native-baseline/override serializer. After download, open the corresponding GitHub editor, retaining current-page fallback when popups are blocked. Failures show an error, without leaving a blank tab. Opening the editor is not creating an Issue.

All P2 adapters reuse `Shell/diy2-generic.sh`. Its `zzzz-weig-system` UCI overlay follows the audited numeric/zzz native defaults. LAN changes only ipaddr, retaining topology, protocol, netmask and IPv6. No theme Makefile or `config_generate` edits remain. Optional `firmware.themeMode=inherit` preserves the native runtime theme; `explicit` applies the selected one. Old requests without that field retain explicit-theme semantics. Blank passwords under prompt policy preserve native credentials; unknown native defaults are not advertised as empty.

Integration diagnostic: `node tools/test-submit-browser.mjs`. It reuses the CDP driver with a local preview and real Catalog, downloads JSON/.config, re-imports, opens the correct GitHub editor and checks requests with the real parser. Chrome and network are required; no Issue/workflow/firmware build is created. The script prints its evidence directory.

`site/wrt/config/site.json` is the public web configuration source; its `catalog.loading` object is the existing loading-scheduling contract. `config/build.json` is the build-side configuration source and must not be read by the browser:

```json
{
  "catalog": {
    "loading": {
      "startup": ["menu", "menu:language", "package-mirrors"],
      "idle": ["applications", "hidden", "help", "compatibility"],
      "startupConcurrency": 3,
      "idleConcurrency": 1,
      "idleDelayMs": 15000
    }
  }
}
```

The menu, its active language shard, and package-mirror projection load together after first paint with bounded concurrency. Other assets follow the low-priority queue without competing with the active Source/Branch. Matching ref/bytes/SHA-256 cache entries are reused. Submit and self-check still await required assets, so background timing can never skip compatibility validation.

Curated applications remain an idle asset. Entering or interacting with the plugin section promotes that one asset to user-demand loading while retaining the same Promise, cache, and executor. The section must show an explicit loading state before data arrives and a generic error/retry action after failure; an empty panel must never masquerade as “no plugins.”

Local preview regenerates its virtual `build-meta.json` from the current VERSION, site SHA, Git branch, and commit on every request, so a long-running server cannot retain its startup identity across Prepare. Only an actual HTTP 404 may represent optional mainline metadata. Network failures, invalid JSON, and metadata that disagrees with `site-version.json` must stop bootstrap instead of silently falling back to `main/catalog-data`.

The default package mirror follows the selected firmware timezone, never the browser timezone: `Asia/Shanghai` selects automatic routing and every other timezone selects the source default, with an availability-based safe fallback. A timezone change recomputes only a non-explicit selection. Manual and imported explicit selections remain stable, and import awaits the same shared mirror promise before validating its value. Retired mirrors are removed only from canonical `config/policies/package-mirrors.json`, then the public projection is regenerated; an unavailable imported ID follows the generic fallback. TUNA's [official mirror-site change](https://github.com/tuna/mirror-web/commit/9d31d4b34471ca68037993541af8437d866fc885) announced that OpenWrt sync stopped on 2026-08-09, so it is no longer an advertised preset.

The top build overview reserves flexible desktop width for the Source/Branch/Target Profile locator; its compact contract header contains only the title and chevron, while the full Catalog commit remains in the expanded body and accessible hint. The 641–960 px layout places the locator on its own first row, contract and controls on the second, and expanded content on the third. Mobile stacks those four regions. This layout must not change the separate Advanced menuconfig search contract or reduce expanded-body typography.

Public `site/wrt/data/` contains deployment identity, UI i18n, timezones, and runtime package-mirror assets only; public project, brand, firmware defaults, and Catalog selection/loading policy live in `site/wrt/config/site.json`. `config/build.json` must not enter the static site. Device registries, seed configs, public base configs, plugin metadata, local size snapshots, and the generated package page are retired.

## 3. Catalog applications and sizes

The active branch's native package metadata and LuCI Kconfig options determine selectable applications. Global application metadata supplies reviewed names, descriptions and groups, not availability. A `PACKAGE_` prefix alone does not identify a package: application cards, Probe roots and size accounting share the Catalog model's concrete package lookup. Configuration suboptions stay in Advanced menuconfig. Target-dependent visibility uses the existing Kconfig evaluator; missing translated group labels fall back to the upstream label rather than an internal translation key.

RootFS accounting uses Catalog's branch-specific package-size observations, matching Source/Branch/commit and `TARGET_ARCH_PACKAGES`. Use installed bytes only, never archive bytes or cross-source estimates. Direct selection counts explicit `y` packages still resolved to `y`; total counts all resolved `y` concrete packages, including dependencies, once. `m` packages and configuration suboptions do not occupy RootFS. Missing observations are not zero: hide the estimate when no matching installed-size dataset exists, and report partial coverage otherwise. At 50%/80% of RootFS show yellow/red advisory text; offer the existing capacity editor only when editable. These sums are not a prediction of compressed image size or a build gate.

Catalog's daily translation workflow owns Advanced menu descriptions. It enumerates legacy bundles and schema-6 `menu:<lang>` shards precisely from the data-branch `index.json`, sparse-fetches only those files, and updates both representations. It must not scan or rewrite `core/graph/applications/compatibility`. The default schedule is 04:37 Asia/Shanghai with five batches. Future Source/Branch entries join through the index without a workflow version list.

## 4. Kconfig state and serialization

Compatibility `if-present` applies to the complete rule: a missing participant makes an `all-*` rule inapplicable, never a weaker one-package rule. A schema-6 `preferredDisable` recommendation must pass the shared planner; if blocked, explain why instead of silently removing another participant. Historical schema-5 projections remain readable but cannot convey the newer preference.

Schema-6 import values are serialized Kconfig tokens. Decode scalar strings once at the import boundary, edit semantic values, and encode once on export, including when migrating old snapshots. Worker reconstruction continues consuming the same canonical tokens; it must not repair quoting or infer user intent.

Curated and Advanced inputs share one intent path:

```text
applyMenuValue → catalog-engine.applyUserIntent → menuValues
```

Advanced menuconfig's `Root Kconfig options / 根级 Kconfig 选项` is the generic display container for Catalog `path: []` records without a parent menu. It is not upstream `Global build settings` and must not be merged or removed. Only the container label is UI text; records, types, states, dependencies, and hierarchy remain Catalog-owned.

Compatibility recommendations also call `applyUserIntent` and share the same Catalog/Kconfig runtime as Advanced menuconfig. Legal N/M/Y states come from option type, visibility, dependencies, and Catalog states; unavailable states must be disabled/hidden before a click. When reaching a compatibility target requires first disabling an upstream selection, `deriveCompatibilityPlans` may only use the reverse Kconfig/package relations already built by the shared runtime; `app.js` must not implement a second dependency scanner.

Generic mutation coverage includes bool, tristate, empty/non-empty string, literal `n`, escaping, int, hex, unknown symbols, conditional defaults, parentheses, `&&`/`||`, deferred state, and closed-world boundaries.

Schema 4 compact relations preserve typed defaults, ranges, visibility, choices, select/imply relations, package capabilities, and expression ASTs through the compact encode/decode round-trip. The optional `graphCompact` asset uses relation schema 5 (`interned-definitions-edge-rows-v1`) and shares definitions/expressions while retaining positional edge identities. Prefer it when advertised, validate its own hash/size/schema, and retain old-asset support when it is absent; validation failure is not a fallback signal. `relationsComplete: true` is authoritative only with `relationCapabilities` containing `complete-kconfig-relations-v1`; that assertion covers the full typed relation graph. `packageClosureComplete: true` with `packageClosureCapabilities` containing `complete-package-build-closure-v1` is an independent, narrower package-build assertion and never upgrades typed relation completeness. Both are producer assertions; absent or partial data remains inconclusive.

Keep indexes and normalized documents scoped to their immutable model/document identity. Provider lookup and forward-dependent discovery must reuse these indexes instead of rescanning every record per symbol or repair candidate. Healthy preflight can return its existing validation result without constructing plans. A failed build target that is already N may contribute forward orphan-cleanup candidates, never new trigger evidence; after user-root actions, preserve shared/protected dependencies and unresolved consumers. Both the planner and UI application use the same derived dependency-symbol set. Test anonymous package graphs, shared/unknown consumers, and ordinary ownership rules rather than maintaining package-name fixtures as production logic.

Default activation includes the owning symbol's dependencies as well as the default's own condition. Theme fallback and compatibility default materialization must not inject defaults for disabled or unresolved owners; dependency worklists must revisit defaults when those owner references become known. Hidden bool/tristate defaults with UNKNOWN dependencies remain deferred. Cover all five Kconfig types with active/inactive/unknown owners, and keep explicit native baseline values distinct from newly inferred defaults. Historical import migration and on-demand checks remain unchanged: import is not a new dialog or immutable-version rejection point.

The shared runtime's lexer must match upstream: bool default `m` remains a typed source value, comments are stripped only outside quotes, and `@` outside quotes produces an ignored-character warning while ordinary AST symbols after it remain intact. Only a complete active-source proof with no unresolved dynamic preprocessing may classify a name as native undefined; an intentionally Target-filtered definition is external only with proven projection provenance, while an unproved omission remains unresolved. Unevaluated dynamic expressions keep relations incomplete. Choice `reset if` is preserved as typed data, but native mconf/nconf clears the global `S_DEF_USER` layer only during an interactive transition from a non-Y choice member to Y. Static import, Worker reconstruction, and unsupported browser reset interactions must report explicit `unsupported`/`deferred` status rather than claim that the global reset is implemented.

## 5. Compatibility schema 2–6

Schemas 2–6 are accepted; schema 6 adds the optional `preferredDisable` preference. Schema 2 retains the legacy rule shape; schema 3 adds exact source/Target scope and structured failure; schema 4 adds rule-level `buildDependency` with exact source commits. Schema 5 separates reviewed wildcard preventive applicability from exact observed evidence. Missing required participants make the entire `if-present` rule inapplicable. The shared graph proves active roots reaching the failed build package; legacy `triggerPackages` is readable but never drives new warnings/actions. The planner produces minimal legal ordered steps, respecting preferences and preserving resolved identities during equivalent-plan deduplication. The browser validates the loaded schema, hashes, compressed/JSON bytes and rule count.

The executor stays:

```text
evaluateCompatibilityRules → deriveCompatibilityPlans → applyUserIntent
```

A recommendation may contain ordered user steps such as disabling an upstream selection before the compatibility target, plus automatic dependent invalidation/cleanup produced by the shared Kconfig runtime. Both must come from the same generic state calculation. The page only renders the plan and sends its ordered steps back through `applyUserIntent`; it never derives dependency facts itself.

Drain dependent changes after every mutation phase, including preferred-value restoration, orphan cleanup, and choice replacement. A nonzero tristate ceiling lowers Y to M rather than N. Planner and application must carry the same preferred, protected, dependency, and explicit-intent context. Collapse candidates only when their ordered actions and effective changes agree; equal-cost different plans remain ambiguous. Existing stale descendants of a tracked disabled owner may receive a reconciliation recommendation without re-enabling that owner. Simulated and applied repairs must make progress without adding blocking violations; failed application restores the editor snapshot, and final preflight cannot reuse an earlier acknowledgement for new errors.

Restoring an imported value to its Native Profile default can remove its user override. The serializer must still project changed effective values over the old imported text, including N; unchanged imported rows need no additional rewrite, and unknown symbols retain the existing preservation policy. Regression coverage includes actual state/controller replay, preference shutdown, already-disabled dependency bridges, shared consumers, choice replacement, M ceilings, equivalent plans, a second Test invocation, and schema-6 export/reimport. Browser checks do not substitute for native firmware builds.

For schema-4 build-dependency rules, reverse Catalog indexes are candidate discovery only. The browser proves each candidate through its forward dependency, select/imply, and package-provider relations, then derives the minimum user-controlled roots plus the failed package. Unknown or ambiguous conditions, alternatives, providers, or edges are inconclusive and produce no guessed warning or action. Legacy `triggerPackages` remains readable for old data but is not a driver for new graph decisions or minimum plans.

The modal renders generic text by `issue`. Applying a recommendation keeps it open; a relevant state change restores the action; force-continue requires a second confirmation view. No rule ID, package name, or conflict path belongs in `app.js`.

Full compatibility preflight and recommendations are on demand: **Test** and schema-6 request generation/download evaluate the final configuration. Page load, import and Source/Branch/Target changes do not open repair modals. Direct plugin/Menuconfig edits may show the debounced nonmodal hint described above, without deriving repair plans. Idle asset prefetch is not evaluation.

## 6. Request and backend

The backend accepts schema-6 `build-request.json`. The request pins Catalog identity and carries only minimal Target/Profile identity plus semantic overrides. The Worker deterministically reconstructs `reconstructed.config` from the request-pinned exact Native Profile baseline plus semantic overrides; that reconstructed file is the authoritative build semantics. A submitted full `.config`, Worker-side click replay, or Worker-side user-intent guessing must not become a second authority.

Browser and Worker reuse `selectCatalogGraphContract` and `validateCatalogGraphContract` in the existing Catalog loader. Index descriptors authenticate the selected asset; `relationsSchema` is optional, not an inferred prerequisite. Validate the decoded schema and any explicit descriptor declaration together. Prefer advertised `graphCompact` (relations 5), otherwise retain the legacy graph; malformed advertised assets never silently fall back. Worker reconstruction requires typed relations 4/5, the complete field layout and capability assertions, source commit/repository, and compressed hash/size; verify uncompressed hash/size when supplied. Request-level legacy bundle schema fields describe a different asset and must not be mistaken for graph metadata. A pre-identity validation failure retains BUILD-LOGS under a run/attempt identity and skips firmware classification/manifest publication; the original failure remains visible.

Defconfig defaults off. When enabled, upstream `make defconfig` may run only after `reconstructed.config` is already determined, as optional normalization. Defconfig must not complete a missing baseline, infer user intent, or replace the pinned Catalog identity. The backend validates format, minimal Target/Profile identity, Catalog contract, firmware settings, and path safety; it does not re-decide plugin dependencies.

Whether Defconfig is enabled or not, the workflow verifies only the effective Kconfig values listed in `request-overrides.json` before download and compilation. The gate does not compare the whole `.config`, read `plugins`, or check untouched baseline entries. If an explicit value changes, it stops with `configuration-override-mismatch` and preserves `config-verification.json`.

Immediately before compilation, the Worker hashes the authoritative `.config`, runs `make prepare-tmpinfo V=s`, and requires unchanged configuration plus non-empty native `.packageinfo` and `.packagedeps`. The recipe-free GNU Make adapter owns compile-edge evaluation; `.packageinfo` owns package/source identity. It preserves native source aggregation, provider guards, variants and host domains without a raw Makefile or guessed-edge fallback. Missing native graph evidence or reachable source identities remain inconclusive.

`PACKAGE_*` is not proof of a concrete package: upstream uses that prefix for package configuration suboptions too. The Worker can emit a job-local symbol-kind receipt from the verified immutable graph and validate its source/graph identity at the closure gate. Proven configuration-only symbols are excluded from package roots, but a real refreshed native package record wins over an older classification. The receipt is not another maintained package database.

The shared reconciliation step materializes applicable typed defaults and mandatory choices before final serialization, not only inside compatibility evaluation. Native declaration order and full choice membership survive Target projection; only proven order permits first-visible fallback. Explicit user values remain authoritative. Newly derived scalar defaults are recomputed after choice/select convergence and removed if their owner becomes inactive. The resulting changes enter both `.config` and schema-6 overrides; old imports and the default-off Defconfig boundary remain unchanged.

For a verified Catalog data-only promotion, run `node tools/stamp-site-version.mjs --keep-version --refresh-catalog-bindings`, then `node tools/dev-assistant.mjs prepare --keep-version`. This explicitly refreshes generated channel bindings without inventing a code version; normal unchanged stamping remains idempotent. After deployment, verify live `data/build-meta.json` and `data/site-version.json`, reload dev, import the historical configuration, run Test, and generate a new request. Re-running an old pinned request still runs the old Worker. A remaining deferred diagnostic is not a passed test, and configuration replay is not a firmware compilation result.

## 7. Actions identity, concurrency, retention

- Run: `staging-time/tag#Issue/Target/Source/Branch/Profile`
- Artifact: `staging-time-tag#Issue-BUILD-LOGS`
- The repository owner has no project-level build concurrency limit; actual parallel execution remains bounded by GitHub-hosted runner quotas.
- Other users have at most three queued or running builds, admitted by Issue creation time and Run ID. Builds no longer use modulo slots, so collisions cannot strand otherwise free capacity.
- Admission and `/cancel` parse `#Issue`, then verify the Issue author through the API; old titles remain recognized during rolling upgrades.
- CONFIG, firmware, BUILD-LOGS, OPTIONAL-PACKAGES, and FIRMWARE-OTHER retain 60 days; RAW-BRIDGE retains one day.

GitHub's native Run-log retention is a repository Setting rather than Workflow YAML; set it to 60 days as well.

## 8. Package probes

The bottom-right web **检** control opens the existing self-test immediately; its header exposes **Package compatibility probe**. Probe and Advanced menuconfig share the same live `menuValues`, and both send the clicked real Kconfig symbol directly through `setMenuValue()` / `applyMenuValue()`. The frontend never reverse-maps `PACKAGE_<name>` to `PACKAGE_luci-app-<name>`: selecting a dependency cannot select a reverse dependent, while selecting `PACKAGE_luci-app-x` may enable `PACKAGE_x` only through the upstream forward dependency relation. Probe's **Selected** summary contains only `PACKAGE_*` values that differ from the current Source/Branch/Target Kconfig baseline, so upstream defaults are hidden; it remains one line and folds overflow behind `+N`. Search rows still show the complete live Kconfig state. The permanent footer policy copy is removed and exposed through an **Info** action to the left of Preview.

Keep the three package layers distinct: the upstream `.config` uses `CONFIG_PACKAGE_<name>`, the Catalog/Kconfig model uses `PACKAGE_<name>`, and the build-closure graph uses the real `<name>` from `.packageinfo` and package Makefiles. Virtual capabilities are provider names only; they do not create `CONFIG_`/`PACKAGE_` symbols or selectable package records, and an owner-provided capability does not conflict with its own owner.

Probe submission uses schema 3. Advanced menuconfig's final config-generation path still presents direct changes and automatic linkage, but the Issue carries only direct `packageIntent` and compact before/after `CONFIG_PACKAGE_*=m/y` projections for every L1-L7 depth. The complete 836-entry UI state or 276-entry post-Defconfig state is not submitted. Catalog normalizes direct Roots again, and each Source/Branch Job resolves dependencies from Catalog Target/Profile selectors plus upstream Defconfig. Source/Branch/Target/Profile and coverage remain separate controls, and Catalog never maps curated application IDs back to packages through `applications.json.gz`.

Catalog asset validation is implicit `L0`, not a selectable depth. Seven short buttons stay on the same row after **Probe depth**; the selected button is highlighted with a check, while full titles and explanations come from Catalog `probeUi.strings` and use the shared site tooltip. The fixed order is `L1 config-resolve`, `L2 package-compile`, `L3 rootfs-integration`, `L4 firmware-integration`, `L5 boot-smoke`, `L6 runtime-health`, and `L7 reboot-validation`. L2-L7 progressively reuse completed stages and build no comparison firmware; every depth requires upstream configuration resolution and Defconfig cannot be disabled. Automatic coverage can try valid fallback targets sequentially inside one Job. The Matrix is capped at 256 jobs. The owner uses full planned concurrency, other write collaborators are capped at three, and visitors cannot start the Matrix. Normalized evidence retains 60 days and full logs 30 days. Only package-caused failure across every legal environment is fully incompatible; evidence never edits rules automatically.

A multi-package failure enters bounded generic delta reduction only after every planned target fails at a package stage, and produces only a candidate minimal failing set. Dependency installation, clone, feeds, build, and boot output make up the 30-day complete log. Infrastructure, download, timeout, and baseline-firmware failures cannot become compatibility conclusions.

The browser generates no standalone `probe-request.json` or config upload. It compresses the schema-3 state into the pre-filled Catalog Issue state field. The default-branch gateway validates the state hash, permission and Issue identity, dispatches the exact code channel, and the worker re-reads the same Issue state before creating a Matrix. The gateway is event-driven and must itself be promoted to the default branch before the public dev/staging/main submission path is live. `workflow_dispatch` remains the maintainer fallback; the requester or a write/maintain/admin collaborator can reply with exactly `/cancel`.

For a new plugin or rule, first reuse existing Catalog data, audit the same type, execution path, and risk, then run the probe for evidence. AutoBuild `app.js` cannot gain package names or dedicated executors. Probe concurrency, coverage, timeouts, and retention live only in Catalog's `.github/automation-policy.json`; AutoBuild keeps only channel mapping, with tests preventing duplicated data and YAML/JSON drift.

## 9. Test and publish

```powershell
node tools/test-catalog-engine.mjs
node tools/test-build-closure.mjs
node tools/check-all.mjs
node tools/dev-assistant.mjs prepare
node tools/dev-assistant.mjs verify
node tools/serve.mjs
```

`check-all` runs executable regressions, JSON/directory allowlists, Catalog-only architecture gates, Actions naming/concurrency/cancel checks, and 60-day retention checks. It carries no device or package case list.

`node tools/test-request-parser.mjs` runs the real Worker CLI offline through index, graph, Native Profile baseline, overrides, and `reconstructed.config`. It covers relation formats 4/5, optional descriptor schema, integrity/identity/completeness failures, and exact override fidelity. For read-only local replay, pass one or more downloaded request JSON paths or HTTPS request URLs; this mode reads pinned remote assets and never dispatches a firmware build. Test both browser import and Worker reconstruction: success in one does not prove the other. After a Worker fix, reload the deployed page and regenerate/resubmit the request; rerunning an old pinned request does not select new code.

When runtime Catalog data changes, validate/publish that snapshot before AutoBuild, then verify CI/Pages and actual browser loading against the intended data channel. Pure code changes may reuse an already validated immutable snapshot; a code promotion alone does not require heavy Catalog regeneration. Normal code promotion is `fix-* → dev → staging → main`. Catalog code and production data have separate lifecycles: Catalog `main` writes only `catalog-candidate`, and only the manual Production Gate may promote that verified snapshot to `catalog-main`. AutoBuild maps dev to `catalog-dev`, staging to `catalog-staging`, and main to `catalog-main`; it never consumes `catalog-candidate`. A fix CI result is not evidence of the actual dev page: verify deployed build metadata, site identity, Catalog provenance/assetRef/completeness, and interactions there.

## 10. Catalog selection and final configuration

Prompt/menu visibility restricts interactive editing, not the validity of hidden native defaults. Absent scalar values are not enabled configuration entries. Worker reconstruction preserves the Native Profile baseline and validates explicit overrides only; it must not run interactive whole-baseline validation. The separate upstream build-closure check remains active. Browser tests wait for the Catalog baseline and fonts before measuring interactive overlays; rendering the shell alone is not a readiness signal.

For a coordinated parser/runtime change, run
`node tools/test-catalog-producer-contract.mjs --producer-root <Catalog-checkout>`.
This explicit integration test compares actual producer relations with the
browser decoder, including every definition variant and provenance field,
then evaluates producer-typed scalar defaults. It is not a runtime dependency
on another checkout and does not replace native Linux or generated-data CI.
String values inside the editor/evaluator are semantic values: decode native
`.config` literals once at import and encode once at export. Kconfig backslash
escapes are not JSON escapes; build-request JSON itself still uses JSON encoding.

`site/wrt/config/site.json` carries only a small `catalog.selection` policy: Source priority, development-branch priority, and preferred Target selector values; `catalog.loading` retains the existing loading-scheduling contract. Catalog remains the sole inventory of real Sources, Branches, Targets, and Profiles. A missing preferred Target must fall back to the first complete valid Catalog path. Defaults apply only to first selection or a new Source/Branch; they must never overwrite the current control, valid state, or an explicit request.

Menu and applications shards converge through one Catalog-ready reconciliation regardless of arrival order. It refreshes curated applications, Advanced, the build contract, statistics, and submit gate. Before menu completion, curated entries are disabled with a loading state; they are not permanently classified as unavailable.

The Advanced title button, programmatic symbol focus, and search field share one asynchronous expansion coordinator. The first non-empty search character expands before the search debounce without losing input focus, duplicating downloads, or allowing an older async request to reverse newer state. Clearing search does not collapse the panel.

In an imported workspace, the semantic `Selected options` button sits left of the import-summary card and its whole button area toggles expansion; restore-uploaded-values remains an independent action inside the summary card. The option workspace sits below that overview and always spans the full row, hides as one unit when collapsed, and uses a one-column mobile overview. If either the import summary or Selected-only state is absent, the remaining card fills the row.

One Catalog/Kconfig effective resolver selects the final `.config` theme. Explicit user state wins; otherwise it evaluates the active Target/Profile packages, defaults, dependencies/selects, and choices. If that remains empty, it walks stable Catalog order and uses the same `applyUserIntent` dependency closure to select the first legal candidate, skipping explicit user exclusions. The resolved symbol and its dependency closure are written explicitly into the generated config and shared by download, self-test, submit, and firmware-settings snapshots. No records or all candidates explicitly disabled are genuine failures; named fallback themes are forbidden.

## 11. Curated-plugin selection state

Curated checkboxes, group badges, bottom statistics, the selection drawer, and the build contract must share one selection state. Catalog Target uses `catalogUserOverrides` as the authority for user intent; only legacy paths use the local selected/removed sets. `removed` means a real exclusion and must never be counted by a label that says “selected.”

When a user returns a value to `catalogInheritedValue()`, the generic normalizer must delete the redundant override and synchronize the curated item as a restore. A default-`n` item must leave no explicit `n` after “select, then cancel.” A default-`y` item remains a real exclusion when disabled and returns to inherited state when re-enabled. Dependencies and conflicts continue to flow only through the Catalog/Kconfig `applyUserIntent` executor.

Curated checkboxes have one visual contract: enabled and unchecked is white, enabled and checked uses the accent color, disabled or locked is grey, and keyboard focus stays visible. Styling depends only on standard checked/disabled states; package names and rule IDs are forbidden.

The bottom bar separates effective Y/M applications from explicit selections. Imported/inherited applications also appear in the drawer without adding user overrides. Inherited items open the existing Advanced editor; restoring intent redraws from effective state. Installation estimates still include only final-Y concrete packages, never M.

Size loading exposes idle/loading/ready/unavailable/error states. Missing exact coverage may be cached; transport/validation errors must not become negative coverage. Retry only on explicit user action or a new import, using forceRefresh on the same Catalog shard loader, without render-triggered retry loops. Existing import logs record status, architecture, shard and asset identity. Optional sizes never block import; unavailable data retains RootFS and the list with an explicit status, not a fake zero or percentage.
